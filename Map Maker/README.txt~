Map Maker

----------------------
INTRO
----------------------
This Python and Pygame application allows you to create 2d maps using custom sprites.
You can easily edit the sprite size, and the width and height of the map.
----------------------
SPRITES
----------------------
You can put your sprites in the /images/ folder.
They must be .PNG format.
They must all be the same width and height.
The width and height must be equal.
They must be named numericaly.
1.png, 2.png, 3.png, 4.png,.....,34.png, etc
YOU MUST NOT LEAVE GAPS IN NUMBERS...!
----------------------
MODE 1 - CREATE NEW MAP
----------------------
To create a new map, this is what you do.
in /data/, create a new text file, and name it "map.txt". (rename old map).
Open the file, and type in 4 numbers, one on each line:
-World Width (Width of the Map)
-World Height (Height of the Map)
-Fill Sprite (Sprite the game will generate as a solid starting background)
-Tile Width/Height
EXAMPLE:
---
50
50
2
32
---
Creates a map with 50x50 tiles, filled in with tile 2, and the tiles are 32 pixles.


Go change the mode to 1, and run the program.
After a second, the program will exit.
Now your new map is done :)

----------------------
MODE 2 - EDIT MAP
----------------------
You edit the map that is called "map.txt" in /data/.
Click on the screen to "paint" tiles.
You can move around your map using the arrow keys.
The titlebar of your application has your x/y coordinates. (of the top right corner)

THE PROGRAM IS NOT FINISHED. IT WILL BE EASER TO TO THE FOLLOWING WHEN IT IS DONE:
-To Change Tile "brush":
Press Space.
Go to the Console Window. (If it is not open, you are going have to run the program from consol/terminal. Sorry :()
Type "b". Enter.
Type the number of tile you want. Enter.
Go back to main window. Your brush is changed.
-To SAVE:
Press Space.
Go to the Console Window. 
Type "s". Enter.
It should save. You can exit or continue editing.
